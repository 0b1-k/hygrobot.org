This build mostly makes use of up-cycled materials, some of our own electronics and enclosures available on &lt;a href="http://nwazet.com/"&gt;Nwazet.com&lt;/a&gt; and many locally sourced items. HyGroBot is powered by a &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; computer running Linux (&lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"&gt;Raspbian&lt;/a&gt;). The software at the heart of HyGroBot is entirely written in &lt;a href="http://python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and drives various sensors and actuators which were added organically as we learned and experimented with the system. This HyGroBot prototype is Internet-connected and feeds data in real time to a &lt;a href="http://sen.se/nwazet"&gt;Sen.se dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. The gardening log tracking the growth of the plants is also available as a Google Docs &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiYzUgQ9ygHIdEVsWjA0LW5YSTZaWFVTM3dLY2RENHc#gid=0"&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. We will publish the schematics, source code and bill of materials used in this build shortly. &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;Follow the project to be notified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This build draws from all the experience that we gained from building the &lt;a href="/hgbv1buildandgrowth"&gt;first HyGroBot prototype&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiYzUgQ9ygHIdEVsWjA0LW5YSTZaWFVTM3dLY2RENHc#gid=0"&gt;lessons that we learned along the way&lt;/a&gt;. In this version, we mostly used readily available parts found at local hardware and gardening stores, some of our own electronics and enclosures available on &lt;a href="http://nwazet.com/"&gt;Nwazet.com&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.blackdogled.com/BDmicro-U.html"&gt;Black Dog LED lamp&lt;/a&gt; and a few new products that we'll release later this month. This HyGroBot prototype uses a &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; computer running Linux (&lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"&gt;Raspbian&lt;/a&gt;) to drive sensors and actuators, while another Raspberry Pi is dedicated to capturing pictures and, eventually, video. These two functions will be consolidated into a single unit in the production version of HyGroBot coming Fall 2013. The software is entirely written in &lt;a href="http://python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; as well. Unlike its predecessor, this second HyGroBot prototype is not feeding its data to the Internet by default: we're designing it so that it can be used 'off-the-grid', with its own web interface and data collection system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/Media/HyGrowBot/Screenshots/ScreenshotHyGrowBot.png" alt="The HyGroBot dashboard" class="illustration"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important aspects of plant growth such as air filtration, moisture control, water and air heating and cooling, dispensing carbon dioxide, preventing light and air leaks, etc. will not be covered in this prototype build. They will be addressed in the commercial version of HyGroBot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will soon publish the schematics, source code and bill of materials used in this prototype. &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;Follow the project to be notified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
